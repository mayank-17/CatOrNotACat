# CatOrNotACat

In this project I have used Neural Networks in order to predict whether a given image is Cat or Not a Cat. This project uses 5 Layered Neural Network and Gradient Descent. Gradient Descent is used to minimize the cost function.
Dataset used is catvnoncat.

Just run the .ipynb file, if any error encounters just check that you have the right dependency or not.
